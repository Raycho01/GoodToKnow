# GoodToKnow

GoodToKnow is an iOS application designed for browsing news. In its development, I prioritized writing clean code and adhered to the MVVM architecture, while strictly following OOP and SOLID principles. The primary goal of the application is to enhance my skills. For news data, I utilized the NewsAPI (https://newsapi.org/).
